Suggestions
Uber can increase the effectiveness of its service by optimizing operations during peak hours, especially between 13:00 and 23:00. The main focus in this period will be increasing fleet availability, perhaps by increasing the number of vehicles on the road and ensuring that tariffs remain competitive. These measures are expected to encourage increased bookings during peak hours. Launching special promotions or discount programs at certain times can also be an effective strategy to increase customer interest.

The following strategy prioritizes service improvements on days and months with the highest number of Uber trips. Increased service on Thursdays and Fridays in May, Tuesdays through Thursdays in July, Fridays in August, and Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in September can maximize the benefits of high usage trends in specific periods. This can include the allocation of more fleets, increased availability, and special promotions that suit customer preferences on those days.

In the long term, Uber can maintain its service improvement efforts in July, August, and September, which saw many Uber rides. Increased vehicle availability, fleet maintenance, and special promotions during this period help consolidate the customer base and ensure service usage remains high.

Although April has the lowest average travel, special measures such as launching special promotions can stimulate customer interest and overcome monthly fluctuations. This approach can help balance demand and ensure continued growth throughout the year.

With total Uber trips peaking at 5:00 p.m., Uber can capitalize on this momentum by launching special promotions. Discounts or attractive offers during peak hours can be an additional incentive for customers to use the service during specific periods.

With Uber's total rides above one million, September shows excellent potential. Uber can develop particular strategies and attractive offers to retain and attract customers during the month. Increased investment in marketing and developing exclusive services in September could be a strategic move.

Finally, further qualitative analysis is needed to understand the factors behind usage fluctuations and trends. Factors such as weather conditions, special events, or changes in marketing strategies may influence travel patterns. Carrying out a thorough evaluation will help Uber design a strategic plan that is more targeted.
