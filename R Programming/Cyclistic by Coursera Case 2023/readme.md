# Cyclistic 2023 by Coursera
## Background
Company: Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in Chicago (fictional). A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. It makes bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled motorcycle.My role: Junior data analyst working in the marketing analytics team
Premise: the director of marketing (my manager) believes the company’s future success/growth depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships
Current marketing strategy: building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments
Approach to the current marketing strategy: flexible pricing plans offering single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships
Other facts: 1) Most riders opt for traditional bikes vs. About 8% of riders use the assistive options, 2) Users are more likely to ride for leisure vs. 30% use them to commute to work each day, and 3) annual members are much more profitable than casual riders, according to Cyclistic’s finance analysts.

The Business Task: Convert casual riders into members.

The marketing team's goal is to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. My task is to answer one of three questions guiding the future marketing program - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The other two questions are: 1) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 2) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Key Stakeholders
Primary stakeholder - the director of marketing
Secondary stakeholders - the marketing analytics team and the executive team

After processing 5.5 million data, a column was produced as follows: Ride ID, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, member_casual, date, month, day, year, day_of_week, ride_length
and produce an analysis as follows:
1) The Average Riding Duration by Rider Type bar diagram shows that there are more casual rider types than member rider types
2) The Average Number of Rides by Month diagram: Casual Riders shows that the most casual type riders are in July or the middle of the year with a total of more than 300K rides, and the least in January or the beginning of the month
3) The most start stations for casual riders are at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, with a total of 45k rides
4) Meanwhile, Used stations by Casual Riders at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave with total rides of 94k
5) Most used stations by members are on Clinton St & Washington Blvd
6) The Number of Rides by Month graph for classic and electric bikes looks the same and is as significant as the average number by Month diagram. But for docked bikes, there are almost no graphics
7) Bike Usage Between members and casual riders by day of the week across the year looks very good in June and July. The highest simple 3 is on Saturdays in June, July and September. Meanwhile, the tallest members were on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August.

## Suggestion to Cyclistic
First, we can optimize promotions by focusing on the benefits of being an annual member. Discounts, exclusive access and special promotions can be a powerful draw. I think communicating clear information about the long-term financial help would be a good idea, especially for drivers who use the service regularly.

Next, through monthly analysis, I suggest targeting promotions in months with many casual riders, such as July. Creating special promotional programs or discounts during this period can encourage conversions. We can also carry out outreach campaigns and free trials of assistance options, considering that most users choose traditional bicycles. Education can help raise awareness about more inclusive assistance options.

Regarding pricing strategy, I suggest price adjustments or special offers to make the annual subscription more attractive. Consider instalment options or discounts for customers who have subscribed for over a year. Furthermore, to increase comfort at popular start stations, we suggest improving facilities such as adding bicycles, information boards, or additional services.

Further analysis of casual riders' preferences and habits can help develop more targeted strategies. We may use data to identify factors that drive more frequent use or conversion to annual members. Next, we can optimize digital campaigns by understanding the most effective platforms and creating content accordingly.

Regular monitoring and evaluation of marketing strategies is the key to success. I recommend the team continuously monitor the effectiveness of the implemented systems and conduct periodic evaluations. If necessary, we can make additional adjustments in areas that need attention.

Local partnerships with businesses or community events can be a strategic move to promote annual membership benefits and increase brand visibility in the community. Lastly, we highly recommend collecting feedback directly from casual users. This can provide valuable insight into simple drivers' obstacles or barriers to becoming an annual member. This way, we can design more targeted solutions to increase conversions.
