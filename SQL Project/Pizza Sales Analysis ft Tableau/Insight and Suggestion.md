## Objectives
Pizza sales data analysis aims to uncover daily and weekly sales patterns, highlighting peak hours and declines in orders to identify opportunities for increased sales. By detailing performance during specific hours, the second goal is to design specific strategies to maximize sales during the most influential periods. Additionally, the focus on weekly analysis aims to identify significant order variations and isolate factors that may influence such fluctuations. This project aims to improve overall sales performance through marketing strategies or special promotions during periods with the highest orders.

Next, an analysis of pizza categories and sizes aims to understand their respective contributions to sales, total orders, and number of pizzas sold. By identifying customer preferences for certain sizes, marketing strategies can be optimized to target the most popular pizza sizes. Regarding revenue, the goal of the analysis is to determine which pizza products are the main drivers of total revenue, while on the quantity and total orders side, focus on the pizzas with the highest sales. Finally, to improve the performance of certain products, such as the Brie Carre Pizza, an in-depth analysis is carried out to identify the factors causing low performance, aiming to develop specific improvement and promotional strategies to maximize sales and revenue contribution from the pizza.

## Suggestion
Based on the insights provided, as a business data analyst, I recommend several suggestions to pizza companies to improve performance and respond to findings from data analysis:

1. Optimize Services at Peak Hours:
    Focus marketing efforts and staff supplies during peak hours, especially between 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and in the afternoon, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Ensuring sufficient product availability and prompt service during this period can increase customer satisfaction and sales potential.

2. Weekly Marketing Strategy:
    Take advantage of significant variations in weekly orders by designing special marketing or promotional strategies during periods of highest orders. This may include special offers, discounts, or loyalty programs to increase customer retention and encourage repeat purchases.

3. Strengthen Classic Category:
    Given the significant contribution of the Classic category to sales, total orders, and number of pizzas sold, the company should consider developing and promoting more products in this category. It's also possible to create special packages or offers involving classic products.

4. Promote Large Size:
    Since Large pizzas have a high contribution to the total pizza size, companies may consider promoting this size more by offering discounts or special packages for Large pizzas to encourage sales of this product.

5. Maximize Featured Products:
    Based on the findings that Thai Chicken Pizza and Classic Deluxe Pizza have the highest contribution to revenue, total quantity, and total orders, companies should maximize promotion and marketing focus on these products. This may include putting together special packages or promotions to encourage further sales.

6. Brie Carre Pizza Strategy Evaluation:
    Regarding Brie Carre Pizza, which has a low contribution, the company needs to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the causes of this low performance. It may be necessary to identify whether there are issues with taste, price, or marketing. After that, special improvement or promotional strategies can be implemented to increase sales of this product.

By implementing these suggestions, pizza companies can improve operational efficiency, increase sales, and maximize the contribution of key products to the company's overall performance.
